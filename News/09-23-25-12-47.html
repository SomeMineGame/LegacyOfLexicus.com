        <h1>Legacy Of Lexicus Dev Update 1</h1>
        <p>Hello, SomeMineGame here. I wanted to give you an update on the development of the Legacy Of Lexicus. Since I've started college, progress has slowed down a ton. On top of being a full time college student, I also work a part time job. There have also been a lot of personal and family related events. I also have to look after myself as I have health issues. I'm still trying to work on the site when I get a chance, as seen by the split in the someminegame.com and legacyoflexicus websites, but changes aren't very significant and updates to the official sites have long gaps.<br><br>With that being said, I don't know when progress on the servers themselves or the bot will continue. It's harder for me to dedicate the time to work on the logical compentents than it is for me to work on the website. Currently I'm just doing bug fixes and slight redesigns on the Lexicus site. There's a lot of updating, planning, debugging, and the work itself is more tasking for me when it comes to the servers and bot. Under a worst case senario, I do have a plan in place to pass on the project temporarily until I'm able to resume it comfortably. There is currently NO plan in plan to end the project.<br><br>If you want to view the live editions of the pages and see changes as they happen, you can visit the <a href="https://development.legacyoflexicus.com">Legacy Of Lexicus Development Site</a> or the <a href="https://development.someminegame.com">SomeMineGame Development Site</a>. They both update as soon as a file changes! Do be warned that my priority is on the Lexicus Wiki, so the development page of my main site won't change.<br><br>Thank you,<br><i>SomeMineGame</i></p>
